Version2's code is basically an refined Version1. I use String and .toCharArray() instead of 2 dimensional boolean array because String does visualization better. The code now has better maintainbility, readability and time-complexity.

I refer to the website above and write a `Banner.java` to simplify the use of the method. The `Banner.java` has better control over the size, colour, font family of the message.
