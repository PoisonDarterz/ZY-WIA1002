# WIA1002 (Data Structure)

Welcome to the [**WIA1002**](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/view.php?id=146) (Data Structure) Github repository, which contains a range of study materials for the course. 

WIA1002 is offered by the [**Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT)**](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my/) at the  [**Universiti Malaya (UM)**](https://www.um.edu.my/) in Malaysia. In this repository, you will find notes, questions, source code, and explanations for the Tutorials and Labs (UM-WIX1002) that accompany the course.

To get started, feel free to browse through the materials and use them to supplement your learning. Hopefully that you find this repository to be helpful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

## Couse Introduction

In this course, we will be exploring data structures and algorithms using the [**`Java`**](https://dev.java/learn/) programming language.

Throughout the course, we will learn about fundamental data structures such as `LinkedList`, `Stack`, `Queue`, `BinarySearchTree`, and `Graph`, as well as popular algorithms like `Bubble Sort`, `Insertion Sort`, `Selection Sort`, and `Merge sort`. To enhance your understanding of these topics, you will also be required to implement basic versions of these data structures and algorithms.

This course is ideal for freshmen who are taking the [**WIA1002**](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/view.php?id=146) course or [**WIA1002**](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/view.php?id=146) learners who are looking to improve their programming skills. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, which will help you excel in your future programming endeavors.

## Repository Introduction

This repository contains study materials for the [**WIA1002**](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/view.php?id=146) course, including notes, questions, source code, and explanations for Tutorials/Labs (UM-WIX1002). It is worth noting that this repository contains two versions of the Lab: [**Version1**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version1) and [**Version2**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2).

[**Version1**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version1) is the main Lab used throughout the course. It requires students to implement data structures and test them to ensure they function correctly. [**Version2**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2) is an older version of the Lab, but it is more challenging and provides a deeper understanding of intriguing and typical algorithmic puzzles such as [**N Queen Problem**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2/Lab5%20-%20Stack/Q3), [**Maze Problem**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2/Lab5%20-%20Stack/Q6), and well-known algorithms including `Quick Sort`, `Merge Sort`, and `Heap Sort`. In addition, we will explore the shortest path algorithm in Graph, such as `Bellman-Ford Algorithm`, `Dijkstra's Algorithm`, and `A* algorithm`.

In a nutshell, [**Version1**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version1) is ideal for building a solid foundation of data structures, while [**Version2**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2) is suitable for those who want to learn more about data structures and algorithms. [**Version2**](https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/tree/main/Lab/Version2) is also a great choice for those who are interested in competitive programming.
